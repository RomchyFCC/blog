Day 29

Well, I honestly thought I would have done more today.

I had 6 hours of material to get through and it would be easy to do it in 6 hours if I just followed the code and wouldn't actually pay attention.

I tried to take in as much as I could so it lasted the whole day, I'm finally done with the JS30 course so tomorrow is solo exercise time.

Gonna do 2 more CSS exercises(well try to do) and one whole template probably envolving jquery.
Hopefully I do them all tomorrow so I can start my FCC journey ASAP.

That's it, happy hacking!
