Day 95

I've done more refactoring of the code today. For now I think it's enough, tomorrow I shall focus on my wordpress blog and pictures for the portfolio. I will also focus on our open source project.

Then and only then is it finally time to dive into typescript and game development. Finally!

Good night!
