Day 17

Not the most productive day, I finished the practical javascript course and did some minor change for the collaboration project and that was it, I laid back a bit today.

Will tackle the to do list problem tomorrow! 

It's funny because I'll be working on a full featured to do list and it's also on my to do list hah.

More concrete update tomorrow

happy coding!
