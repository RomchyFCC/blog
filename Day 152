Day 152

I did some programming but mostly developed with wordpress.
Getting a lot more experience with wordpress lately, it's fun but it gets boring on times.

I realised today that I haven't devloped anything with javascript in a while, so I should get my react project going.
Start up the old engines again :D

That's it, I'll also create a quick progress report right now.

Happy coding!
