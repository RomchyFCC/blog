Day 26

Ugh, why do I find mongoDB so confusing, everytime i try to install it i lose my nerve dealing with endless shit storms of complexity.

Install this, install that hotfix, play around in the CLI play around with the program, install atlas, gosh....

Could have been simpler....

I eventually got it to work but it drained all my energy, I'll continue tomorrow with the homework from the course and then finally move on.

Bad day for programming, didn't really do a lot. Haven't even tested out the database but the server ran without errors so I assume it works.

For my sake i hope it does...
