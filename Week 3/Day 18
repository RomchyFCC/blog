Day 18

Awesome learning day, I haven't done any courses or read any books, BUT, the solo project of the todo list is coming along nicely. I hope I finish the core functionality tomorrow so I can start styling it asap with sass and bootstrap.

Well that's it, I guess I'll have more to say when I finish the project :)

Happy coding!
