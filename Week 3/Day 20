Day 20

I am feeling wierd lately, I took a whole days break today, I couldn't get my mind to do anything except just wander off.

I'll start with a new course tomorrow which should hopefully teach me more about node.js, ajax, jquery, basicly everything java related haha

I'm excited, I hope i feel better then i did last 2 days :/

ttyt!
