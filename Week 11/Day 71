Day 71

It's been a good day, I have done 3 react courses and redone 1. I think I am ready. The sketch for my next project has been made and I have a rough idea where to start tomorrow.
I'm excited for tomorrow to be honest and can't wait to wake up fresh and rested to start owning the day.

I could go more in-depth about the projects I had done today but it seems moot so I'll call it for today.

Happy codin'!
