Day 77

Week 11, looking back I can't believe I came this far, one more week and I'll be doing this for 3 months.

Today I did some preparations for tomorrows interview and I optimized and deployed my react project on my website.
It's a solid start, I also contacted the company associated with my project to provide some feedback on legal issues.

Hopefully they green light the project because some exposure in the dev world would be really useful.
I guess, I'm hopeful for tomorrow to provide some answers to where my journey leads.

I'm nervous about D day but all outcomes are prepared for so it's just the fear of unknown that is eating at me.

No worries though, I feel like I can take on every challenge I face and tomorrow is no different.

Happy coding!
