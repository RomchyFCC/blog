Day 65

I designed almost all of front page for my blog in wordpress, I made a very light-hearted developer design.
The whole point of my blog is going to be to document my journey and maybe put a smile on a face of my readers if they ever exist :)

Currently there is nothing on my portfolio site to bring users back to it, which I completely understand, but maybe it would be nice to get some new friends to chill with.

I also did some react course, like I said I was going to do. I am going to pause my wordpress site for tomorrow and gather all my strength to start building in react.
I want to build 2 projects at once because my table of contents and projects keeps getting bigger. Already around 15 projects on it and around 20 new skills to learn aswell.

Almost forgot, I have to switch out the picture of my projects in my portfolio, the pictures are way too big.
Breaking my own promise from yesterday where I said: "I'll try not to start every sentence with I....", not going so well it seems :/

Honestly, it's quite hard to run a blog about yourself without using I, go ahead try it LoL :D
Happy coding!
