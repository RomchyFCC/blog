Day 2

Not the most productive one sadly.

I did manage to almost finish up with the course from Shay Howe over at 'https://learn.shayhowe.com/'

But it wasn't enough, I could have done more.
I relearned the html elements html5 provides, like the img or cite and stuff of this nature. I made the page look ok on fullscreen on computer, it's no way near a responsive page for now, might decide to make it in the future.

I also learned about the issues on git hub. My friend Darren @ 'https://github.com/DarrenfJ' was kind enough to land a hand on a collaboration practice where we will learn to use git hub better. Which also reminds me, anyone (if it's still open by the time you read this) can join us on that project. We will try to bring more people in as we go.

My plan now is to finish the Shay Howe course and hopefully learn even more about html and css.
