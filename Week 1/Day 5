Day 5

I finished my responsive website, I learned a lot about @media queries and how to use them. Although, my previous statement yesterday, I went back to codeCademy and also did the course on responsive we design...it was as expected, underwhelming, but I did it anyway and it seems i will continue in this workflow for now.

I've set up some guidelines on what to learn next, I will be working towards understanding and usage of flex-box. After that, I will start working with SASS and only then will I try the P1XT suck less at css challenges. If I do those with relative ease, I will continue my path on JavaScript and JQuery. I have some foundation there but I am not yet comfortable using it in my web pages.

Once that is done I will start publishing my work on github pages, so I can't wait for that. It's gonna be exciting to say the least. I wonder how long all of this will take me. I will give it a beginners 2 weeks, tops.

Good luck me and happy coding!
