Day 7

Interesting day and also week behind me. Not particulary proud of today but most certainly proud of the whole week. I have done a lot and i feel like i am on the right track to success and knowledge.

Feels good to have so much under my belt in this short amount of time. makes me excited for what's next.

The google responsive design course today was a bit underwhelming, I might have gone in with too high hopes.
It was an ok course but i don't feel like i've taken a lot out of it, maybe it's my fault.

Was a bit distracted the entire day, but no, i shouldn't make excuses. I need to work even harder.

LET'S GO WEEK 2

happy coding!
