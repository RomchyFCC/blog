Day 55 

Portfolio coming along nicely, I'm almost done with base styles and responsiveness, need to fix up the navbar.

Once that is done, I will get to segment all my css code to make it more maintainable because right now it's a huge mess.

I plan to do that tomorrow along with all the logic in interactivity on javascript part.
And if by some miracle I manage to do it, I'm pretty much done and the only thing left to do is refactor the projects and put them in there.

I'll focus on the resume later :D

Good day!
