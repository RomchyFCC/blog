Day 40

It's funny how one messed up day can have lasting effects and throw you off your flow state.

I was coding hard last week, did many challenges, knocking big projects out of the way and now...

Well basicly soaking in self pity because i couldn't crack one algorithm that was intentionally over complex, which, to be fair, i had previously completed but not at 
that kind of complexity.

My projects have fallen behind and my recent lack of motivation is getting out of control. Yesterday, I took a personal day, I was in a tournament and I wanted to prepare.
Today I wrote 3 lines of working code, it's embarrassing.

I'm trying to get my s*** together. Hopefully I can complete the last 2 projects of FCC front end by the end of the week. I would say tomorrow but 
I usually like to prepare for the worst and plan for the best.

I'll even try to take revenge on that algorithm!
