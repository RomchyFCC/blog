Day 57

Just bought my domain name, I am so close to putting my portoflio on the internet I can almost taste it but alas, I ran out of time today.

I completely made the site, I have a working form the only thing missing is the backend and I am not sure how I am going to implement it yet.
I can easily do it in PHP or python.

I guess I'll decide tomorrow when I get around to exploring my domain name and hosting services.

Happy hacking
