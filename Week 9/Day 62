Day 62

I've spent the whole day working on the wordpress theme I'm building for my website.

I need certain functionalities but I want to do it myself so I'm spending a lot of my time in the wordpress docs and stack overflow.

I uploaded some of my progress, a small snippet, since I'm working locally in a completely different folder and I'm not gonna transfer all the files.

That's it for today, tomorrow I plan to style up most of the wordpress blog in a similar theme I have my website set up.

Happy hackin'
