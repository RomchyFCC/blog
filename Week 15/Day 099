Day 099

Almost there, I did some courses today because I was busy most of my day. I did not have a lot of time to program. But I made 3 algorithms, prepared my portfolio for a big update and
tomorrow is go time for the wordpress blog I want to make. 

I've finished most of my planned projects so tomorrow is the last step of the portfolio upgrade mission. After that it's back to learning, planned curriculum involves typescript, precalculus, GD50, redux.
Most of my next month or what's left of it will revovle around those subject and when i get through those I will begin with D3 and complete data visulaization certification on FCC.

Happy coding!
