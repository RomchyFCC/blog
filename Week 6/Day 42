Day 42

Amazing stuff right there, I just finished Front End Certification from FCC.

Even though I'm kinda late by 2 days, it's still pretty good.

I will be taking some "time off" now and by time off I mean, going through some programming books.

I think that now it will be much easier to understand them and after I'm done with that I will do some other programming stuff, before I jump back in for the Back End Certificate.

I'm excited, LET'S GOOOOO
