Day 12

I'm exausted. I finished Wes Bos course on Flexbox, too easy and also I had a feeling i know more about flexbox than him the entire time. It seems he was really early to the scene when he made those videos and didn't really learn all of it before production. It was so "cut and dry", I am disapointed and I hope that GRID course and JS30 are better(I think JS30 is much better but we will see).

I also finished the responsive design tutorial by Net Ninja, which i liked because it explained the use of picture semantic element in html.

I started with bootstrap today but I almost fell asleep behind my desk and I decided to stop halfway through.
I have 2 more days to finish up with bootstrap and SASS and then I get into javascript(finally).

This is gonna require quite the push because i still have some stuff to do. From what I counted I have 4 hours of video material and that's not counting the project work.

That's it for today.

Happy coding
