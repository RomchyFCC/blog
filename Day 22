Day 22

Well this day was overwhelming, I couldn't do the assignment from the course which is to implement a calculator in javascript.

I'm fairly certain that this is one of the harded challenges in the langauge it self, I feel like i'm in a never ending paradox of bugs :/

Everytime I figure out how to remove one bug 3 more pop up and I had to rework the entire code 3 times just so I can fix the bugs I created.

Obviously my amatuerism is playing a huge part in this but damn this is hard.

I'll get back to cracking it tomorrow, I may have found a way today but it's too alte to type it all out and test it.

Happy coding!
