Day 90

Almost done with the dungeon crawler game, I would have finished it today, but a friend asked me to help him with his job application, so I did that.

For tomorrow, I have to do some health checks on enemies and create appropriate responses and also make a display for the player and a table of contents, so it's easily understandable.

Almost almost almost, the code is ugly though, I might come back to it and refactor it after next week, I'm excited to start building my next project.

Good night!
