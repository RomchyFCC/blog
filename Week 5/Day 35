Drifting at optimal speed.

I am doing more and more lately, the projects are not really something to brag about neither are the algorithms i do but I get them done.

I hope at one point I'll go back and remake every last one of them, because I just know I can make them faster, 
but with the current knowledge it's not possible without losing at least 3-4 hours per algorithm.

They slow me down enough as it is, so I just wanna plow right through to the projects :)
