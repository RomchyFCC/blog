Can't say much for this day honestly,
I pushed through some tedious articles/course whatever, 
don't really feel like I've learned much, kinda a wasteful day :/

But now that that's done, I can finally do FCC, I think I'll enjoy the curriculum so I might even do a beta after it :)
Somewhere in the future of course.

Anyway, I'm hopefull for tomorrow.

Peace out!
