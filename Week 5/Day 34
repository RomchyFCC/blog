Today was a very good day, according to FCC I did over 50+hours of actual work.

That being said, I am aware that those are the times a complete beginner would need ( probably ) and are the absolute max someone should take to do them.

That means 2 things, I can be very productive and I actually have enough knowledge and a good enough skill set to work optimally on front end projects.
I am starting to feel like an actual front end developer.

I am lacking design but I don't feel like that is something I could learn, since things that look good to me, look bad for others.

I will try though...

Happy coding ya'all
