Day 31

Awesome stuff, I did the portfolio challenge on FCC and done some of the basic algorithms.

The portfolio was pushing my comfort zone a bit with navbar handlers and mailto function which I used to substitue the lack of back end on my form :D

It was fun especially towards the end, again I didn't go the extra mile with responsivness but one day I'll just go nuts and do them all in a batch.

To be fair I really should do it soon before I forget how to make a media query hahah

Happy coding!
