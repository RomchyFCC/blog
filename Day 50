Day 50

It's been some time now, I attented my first ever meetup. Topic of discussion was angular + angularjs and how you can manage your build and teams with micro apps.

It was an interesting experience and in just 2 weeks a new meetup is scheduled so i'm excited about that. I might actually stay and mingle :$

Anyway today I did 2 React exercise, one involved with a course on edx, which should remane nameless as it wasn't really of any value, but 
I got some cool ideas to implement in react when i get the time.

The other one was a crash course on react by brad traversy. Nothing much to it, basic use of react and api integration and that was it.

I think I got some solid hands on experience so I will start using it in my future projects, which is actually now.
If you noticed in the 4th <p> I wrote "when i get the time", that refers to my immediate future plans, which are the following:
- I am going to build up my portfolio
- I am going to develop my brand 
- I will start applying for jobs

Meanwhile all of this is going down, I will continue to learn to the best of my ability, deploy all the projects I have set up to deploy(looking at my billboard, there is at least 10 of them) and
after all that is done, I expect to have a job or a startup.

Wishful thinking? Maybe, but I rather prove myself wrong on that one.

Happy coding, ttyt! (short for talk to you tomorrow)
