Day 16

Today, there was a lot of JavaScript programing and DOM manipulation. I finally learned how to actually display code in the html, which means that sooner or later I will start building fully interactive sites.

I'm almost done with the course but I had a lot of pauses for the new knowledge to really sink in and that's why it's taking almost 2 full days.

I'm feeling good about this, I can't wait to try all this stuff in a real project :)

I also realized, that these blogs or snippets of what has been done in relation to programing in a day are kinda boring or more like not styled properly.

It should go without saying that I am most certainly not a writer, I write what pops into my head and i mostly write it for myself, though for claritys' sake I will try to better myself and write better ones :D

Happy coding!
