Day 23

Ok, so quite an interesting day.

I finished the calculator project and I realized that I have some trouble with logic on a bigger scale, I had to think like in chess 3 or more moves ahead to find the bugs.

But with the help of the debugger, I got it all fixed, so yea the barely functional calculator is finished.

I plan to make a project on it as it seems really complex and the JQuery experinec I got on it was great.

Now I started with exercise 4 from the course and React.JS is giving me trouble. It's the first time I've seen the code and I can't seem to quite understand it yet,
hopefully tomorrow will be better and I can do a cool project with that.

I have high hopes and I'm excited.

happy coding!
