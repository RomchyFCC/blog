Day 118

Being overwhelmed finally showed, I couldn't come home in time and work on my daily posts even though I have been programming on the same day.

I am working a lot with php and mysql so i'm leaning toward learning those 2 more in-depth.

Waiting for my work computer to achieve the ultimate work-flow and finally set up my github where I will be able to update my github more regularly.

Good night!
