Day 96

Tomorrow is going to be an exciting day, I really hope it's going to be all positive. I haven't done any heavy lifting today, all prepared for tomorrow though.
Have about 5 things lined up and I reckon I'll be done with the portfolio update so that should be cool.

I hope everything works as expected, not much more to say.

Happy coding.
