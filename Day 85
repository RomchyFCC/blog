Day 85

I gave the Recipe Box some basic styles and local storage.

Started the game of life but got stuck fast thinking of how I should implement it.
I'm going to take another crack at it tomorrow.

By the way, yesterday was also the official 3 month period. I far surpassed what I wanted to achieve so I'm taking it a bit more easy at the moment.
I'll be updating the blog readme tomorrow when I make a full recap of what actually happened in the last month.

Good night!
