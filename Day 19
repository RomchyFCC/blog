Day 19

Big day, I finished my first ever solo project.

I'm feeling great, I think I did well with it. It can be optimised of course, but for the current knowledge I have, I'm happy with it. I might try to improve it in the future but for now I have to move forward.

I can't believe I don't have more to say, I've been grinding at the project for the last 2 days and I'm absolutely exausted.
So yea, done for today.

Happy coding!
