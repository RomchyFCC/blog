Day 54

The portfolio is coming together nicely, I added some shading and made a solid looking form, needs some more tweaks but looks kinda rad :D.

The rest of the day was more or less social healing, much needed. Now I feel rejuvinated and I'm ready to get back in to the game :)
I hope I finish the portfolio by the end of this week.

I should be able to to be honest.

Happy hacking!
