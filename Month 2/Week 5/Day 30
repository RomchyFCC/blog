Day 30

What an awesome day,
I was able to complete a whole project and 2 practice exercises for CSS, I actually did more then I planned to do.

This is good, the template remake (the project) seemed quite good, I got most of the functonality in.

I had some problems animating display of portfolio but i decided that time/problem ratio isn't worth it so I was basicly done.

Both sites are quite alike but I have no added responsivness in mine. Might add it in the future but most likely not, unless I strictly decide I need to practice RWD(which I should to be honest but not right now :D).

It was quite exciting, tomorrow I check some codecademy docs and then I hit FCC. Gonna pursue FCC certification!

Happy hacking :)
