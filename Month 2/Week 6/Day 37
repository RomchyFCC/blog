Day 37

Yea i started with headers again, it just so happens that it helps get the first words of the "keyboard"? I dunno, can't really say tongue can i?

Anyway, once the first words get rolling everything else just flows, it's just so unfortunate that that happens on the most programmically boring day.

I haven't done a lot today, I felt quite demotivated, maybe a bit burned out from all the bonfires :/ necessary evil I guess...

Back to scheduled programming tomorrow then.

Peace
