Day 38

I could have done more, it's uncanny I always say that, yet I don't do anything about it.

I finished the pomodoro project, I even took time to really polish it and make it responsive.

Yaaay, still though, I could have done more for the next project, the tic tac toe game.
I should finish it by the end of tomorrow, that would be the only way I would be happy with tomorrows outcome.

I am quite ahead of FCC planned hours, which is nice, but might also be the main reason I'm slacking :/

Front end development is going really well for me and everything is really easy.
I think I should dive into object oriented design more, get some complexity back in the game and stuff, yea...

Hopefully I'm done with FCC front end part by the end of this week and i can dive into the books I haven't read yet.

Wish me luck!
