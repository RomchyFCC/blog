I've done a lot of algorithm scripting today, so I was a bit less active with other projects.

I could link the FCC profile page but the algorithms are basicly lost upon submiting them so there is no use to doing so.

I am noticing that I am solving the algorithms faster, which is good, I mean I don't expect to ever see them again but they really are great practice
for getting to know some of the methods we can use for arrays, objects, strings,...

Doing the rest of them by the end of tomorrow then back to projects. Can't wait.

DO ALL THE HACKS!!!!
