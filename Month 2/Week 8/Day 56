Day 56

Jumping a bit ahead of the schedule, I wanted to make my portfolio around month 3, but given the circumstances, I decided to do it now.
It's finished, all I have to do now is make the form post the information to a server and voila, all done.

I added all the functionality, it's pretty basic/non-invasive stuff.
I did not want to over do it, subtlety is key here, I think.

That's it, I'll be working on the server tomorrow and will also review what I had done in the last month.

Happy hackin'!
