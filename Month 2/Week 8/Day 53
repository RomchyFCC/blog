Day 53

I completely changed up thy styles of my portfolio, looks slightly more professional now, at least I think so.
The blue color in monochromatic style makes it look so childish, but with the style I gave it now, it looks more metalic and futuristic.
I really don't know, i'm not great with design, I go with what looks cool to me. 

Peace out :)
