Day 44

Still nothing of huge interest...

I completed the rest of FCC Algorithms and started with the books, that's basically it.

I haven't really learned many new things except for the fact that this condition in javascript (3<2<1) === true, because it goes from left to right and checks
(3<2) which === false and then it checks (false < 1) which is true because false is coerced to 0 and 0 < 1 === true.

Pretty cool! 
But yea, besides that I am just refreshing some teoretical knowledge!

Happy coding
