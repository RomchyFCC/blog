Day 49

Ugh, I hope the worst is now behind me, whole week of doing mostly nothing really...Yes I've read 6 books on programming and started learning react, BUT BUT BUT....
I know I could ahve done more, I really hope that I get back to regular progress now, and put all this negative stuff behind me...

Rough week for sure
