Day 46

I cut my week of reading short, not because I have commitment issues, but because I was retaining 10% of everything I read.

That is just not a good use of time, at all.

I decided to dedicate 1 day per week to reading, starting next saturday, because I just have to develop something new, I'm addicted :D

I started a course on javascript again, just to refresh my memory and deepen the understanding more.

Repetition = key to success?

Or so I've heard, whatever.

Onwards, Wilson!
