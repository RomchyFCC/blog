Day 117

Doing more backend work at my job, API calls, mysql and php. I am actually learning quite a bit, most comes down to just API docs and some good ol' advice from my team.

Great feeling to be working on a project of this size, it gives a lot of perspective to my other work I've done so far.

Unfortunately, I did have to say good bye to my game dev team. The time left for the project won't be enough to keep up with them :(

Good night!
