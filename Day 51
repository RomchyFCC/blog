Day 51

Thre we go, started with my portfolio page, I already made a mock-up on sheets of paper, set up starter files, I am ready to go.

I'm excited for this project, I will give it everything I got. Bigger update tomorrow when i get things done to see if I get any problems with the project.

Happy coding
