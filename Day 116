Day 116

I tried to crack my work database problem but I couldn't do it. Will have to try more things, hopefully I can get some help from my team on this and not waste too much of their time.
It's a huge knowledge leap for me and because of it I will have to part ways with my game development friends and fully focus on this.
I'll make it official tomorrow when I have more time and energy and hopefully they take it well.

Good night!
