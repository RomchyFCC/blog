Day 108 

Yup, impossible task(refer to previous 2 blog days), I have 3 more courses to go through and I am barely grasping the gist of redux.
The whole boiler plate seems so exausting to set up, legit 2 courses that I've done so far, used the first 30 mins just setting up the damned thing,
starting to think redux might be redundant and just start using context.API from react 16.3+.

Other than the failure of getting through all planned courses, wordpress took a backseet and I started working on my first planned app: chess leaderboard.
Planned functionality involves setting up a new player, select 2 players to battle and declaring a winner, which would set up and modify elo and present leaderboard for all players.

This will be a small at home use application for when my friends and I get together to play chess, a small competition and all.

Good night
