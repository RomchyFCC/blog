Day 110

Finished my chess leaderboard full stack app. It can create new players and when picked it calculates new elo for the picked players given the outcome of the game.
It's all connected to a mysql database via php. 
I'm satisfied with how it works, now I have to improve on the idea in future apps.

Kinda a late nighter, took some time off because my brain wasn't functioning that well as I fell asleep during one of redux lectures.

Hopefully I can get more stuff done tomorrow.

GN!
