Day 112

Tomorrow I start a new job, which I'm really happy to get, I'm nervous, but I think once I start working Tomorrow, nerves will fade away.
I just don't know what to expect and that makes me the most anxious :s

I've done some course work today but nothing significant. Gonna get to regular schedule soon.

GN!
