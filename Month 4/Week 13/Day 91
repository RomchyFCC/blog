Day 91

Done, completed the React part of FCC (took me long enough). Before I continue the FCC path I'm going to take some time off to do a project I wanted to do ever since I started this.
I realised I might have to learn PHP more in-depth or get to know node.js. I'm leaning towards PHP for now.

Should be exciting if I find good resources to learn from. EDIT: YEP, decided on PHP, I just connected the database needed for this project to my life dev server and everything couldn't be better.

Happy hacking!
