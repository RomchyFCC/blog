Day 87

I completed the Game of Life, recapped the last month and setup most of my learning path for game development.

It was an exausting day, because I woke up very early today so I am going to bed a bit sooner.

I am going to start with my dungeon like crawler game tomorrow, should be a very exciting project.

Good night!
