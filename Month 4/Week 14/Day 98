Day 98

Getting so close to 100. I've done what I planned for yesterday, I am now done with projects for a while so I will be going back to studying. More React, 
game development and wordpress courses in the future. I like where I am currently at and where my path is headed. A lot of opportunities are opening up and I absolutely love all the people I meet related to 
my path I took. It's a great feeling, it really is.

I'm excited for the road ahead.
