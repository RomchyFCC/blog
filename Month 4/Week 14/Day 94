Day 94

Great productive day, woke up early and got a ton of work done, i completed my passion project, with more advanced logic and I also revisted some old projeects to make them more readable and better.

Today really was a great day. More reworking tomorrow and hopefully I'm done with most of these thing by wednesday :)

Happy hackin'
