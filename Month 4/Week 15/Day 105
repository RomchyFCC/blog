Day 105

Even though I still feel a bit sick, I tried going through the rest of react bootcamp.

And although I am quite comfortable with react now, I am still learning a lot and it feels great.

I'll be done tomorrow and hopefully I can breaktrhough the blog wall that I hit while working in wordpress, the whole process seems so 'un'-developer like :/
Can't make it for the life of me, I don't have the imagination to pull it off, maybe...

Planning on starting GD50 this week aswell, hopefully/finally ...

Happy hackin'!
