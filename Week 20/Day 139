Day 139

I keep going with these daily updates, I wonder what it will be like after 1 year of working experience :D

Anyway, today I corrected one of my older projects and created a new full stack app taht takes input from a mysql database, creates a paginated table and on click at each data displays the output
in raw format and in an html parsed iframe.

It's poorly styled because I'm quite tight on time, but the logic is pretty damn good :)

Good night
