&ast; I would only recommend this to someone who already tried programing and is familiar with syntax and how programs look. First time reading this book I had no idea what was going on, I skipped to CS50 course and went back to the books.
They made much more sense and it was easier to read through and actually understand the topics.

&ast;&ast; Before doing this course, you should be familiar with some of the HTML and CSS just progress easier and understand better.
