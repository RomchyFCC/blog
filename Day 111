Day 111

Did some minor work on my wordpress blog, I just can't put it together, nothing fits.

I want it to be thematically the same as my portfolio but nothing works :/

Been abusing my brain over this design for days now, I just might let it go and come back to it later.

I'm planning on finishing the redux courses tomorrow and maybe throw a quick redux trivia game together before I start work.

I hope I succed, it would feel nice.

GN!
