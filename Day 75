Day 75

All of my town of salem app's logic is done, now I just ahve to grind it out with the styles and voila, passable product for consumption :)

I'm gonna add it to my website as a /app, and with that you could access it, I might make it available through github pages aswell I dunno yet.

Tomorrow is gonna be a cool day if I make it through the CSS grind :D

Happy hackin'!
