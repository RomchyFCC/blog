Day 122

Now that I'm programming on the job, I'm losing all my good habbits, like keeping a log on time and doing courses and getting new knowledge. Don't get me wrong I'm learning a lot for my job, but it's not enough I think.

Gotta get back into the rythm, working on that to be honest and progressing very slowly.

Need 2 more weeks.

Romchy out!
