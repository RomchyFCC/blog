Day 129

Days are finally becoming a bit slower! That's a good sign.
I have already made plans (hopefully short-term ones :D) on what to do next, like I already mentioned a bunch of times, here's a list:
- PHP
- mysql
- trivia in redux
- freelance homepage
- machine learning
- wordpress blog 2.0
- freelance wordpress e-commerce site? (big opportunity)
- API
- data visualization on FCC

this could be done in 2 months, but knowing myself in this current state I believe that is very optimistic
Here's to energy, commitment and determination!
