Day 92

I made a php, mysql, html connection, I'm on a good path to become a full stack dev so it's a nice accomplishment.
I also did this kind of stuff before with mongodb and node.js, but it feels like I'm actually learning this not just merely copying it. I really understand all the code I write as of late.
I can also multi task some of the programming, I really feel like a developer.
Good day,

Good night.
