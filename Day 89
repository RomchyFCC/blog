Day 89

Made a working dungeon game model, a pseudo randomly generated dungeon and a moving player. Tomorrow is interactions day, leveling up, fighting, weapons and experience.
This was actually fun but it exausted me to the point that I got a small headache.

I am also in preparations for a small portfolio update, adding some React projects to the mix.
Shouldn't take to long because I was planning for this when I first made my portfolio, so I will just be adding html tags to the index file and everything will work out of the box.

I also uploaded the rest of my wordpress theme, it's not much really, I will do my best to create something from the free themes available online.

That's it for today.

Happy coding!
