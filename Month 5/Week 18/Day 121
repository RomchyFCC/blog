Day 121

I'll try to help out with some front end and back end problems at work and create a new php program that would get new data, filter it and output an excel file.
Haven't done that before so it should be interesting I think.

I did some programming yesterday, but it's tough to start any course atm because of the slow workflow I am experiencing. It will get better though, soon.

Happy coding!
