Day 119

Given my recent unfortunate mistake in losing all the time in one day, I decided on geting these updates in the morning. 
Since I have nothing new to add from yesterday this will merely explain my actions for today and recap what I've done tomorrow.

It's gonna meke things easier for me in this tough transition.

Happy hackin'!
