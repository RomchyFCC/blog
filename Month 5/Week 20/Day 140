Day 140

Wow, I hit 5 months of programming, quite the road I've travelled. Good things happening.

I'll try to create the report for the month by the end of this week but given the work challenges and tasks, doesn't seem I'll be able to do it.

Today had a bit less development and more time consuming tasks not related entirely to development. I corrected 2 of my projects and sent out one to production.
I imagine I'll have to update the latter one soon? Perhaps.

Anyway, not a lot to say about them, I've started relying on frameworks more now, since they have good basis in internet explorer. Have not developed something in my free time in a while now.
I'll try to get at least 1 big project out next month.

Happy coding!
