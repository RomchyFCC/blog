Day 76

Done with the town of salem app for now. Hopefully people find it enjoyable and easy to use.

I will deploy it tomorrow most likely, after that i'll take some time to prepare for an interview the day after tomorrow.
Should be fun! Can't wait to experience the interview, I really hope I impress them, because I really want to work there, hopefully enough I'll get that message across.

After all that is done, back to the regular schedule of FCC map. Going to do Data visualization and then finally after 3 months of prep tackle THE APP.

THE APP? You ask... it's a personal project that might not even see the light of github, I wanted to build it for a while now, but I wanted to get core concepts down first.
I finally feel ready to take the time and build it.

Happy coding!
