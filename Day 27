Day 27

I decided to leave the last homework for another time, though I finally understood the concepts of databases(well mongodb) and how to work with it, I decided I don't need it for the projects in my mind.

I'll actually need a SQL database for my full stack project.

The course didn't have well written rulesets, so even though I solved the first piece of the last homework and I actually showed a JSON object when entered a specific query, the auto grader thought differently.

So, yea, don't wanna waste too much time figuring out how to please the tests they've written for the course so for now I'm moving on from mongodb. I was happy to finally work with a database and node and javascript and am excited for the next full stack javascript project.

For the next 2 weeks I will be refreshing all the knowledge I have gathered in last month. Once I'm done with that I'll start working on FCC algorithms and assignments. Hopefully I will be done with all the major things from FCC in a month maybe month and a half so I can take a deep dive into automated testing with mocha, faster workflow with gulp, transpilling with babel and so on and so on....

I have a few projects planned aswell.

Time will be short and I think I've put a bit too much on my plate but I will see how I progress in the coming weeks and adjust accordingly.

Exciting 1st month!

Happy hacking
