Day 4

Could have been a lot more productive, but the raging headache didn't help. I am in dire need of fresh air it seems or maybe some workout. 

I have been grinding quite hard, for me of course. I just feel like every pause i take that I am wasting time and not working towards my goal. The feeling is destructive but it might be necessary otherwise I just get lazy.

Anyway, today i went through codeCademy real quick, it seems I outgrown what they offer, everything there just seems so basic and copy-paste-ish, it's not attractive to work on their site thus i am already working on a new project a responsive web page using only html and css.

It's going well i think and if it weren't for my headache i would probably finish it.
I'll finish it tomorrow i need to rest can't even think what to do next, maybe it's time for some reading out in the nature :D

happy coding ya'all
