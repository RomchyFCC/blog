Day 142

Wierd stuff going on, I'll try to keep my composure through the pressures. Done some fixing on my apps today. The more I develop, the more I hate that IE exists and even more the fact that people insist to use it.

It's like people purposely make your job harder so they can get off or something stupid.

Anyway wierd end to the week, I'll try to do the recap tomorrow.

Good night!
