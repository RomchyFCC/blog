Day 86

Awesome news today and more on that on a later date, I finished most of the logic for my game of life, but the program is really slow.

I might try to optimize it somehow, but first I'll try to finish the counter and the rest of the buttons for better control over it.

Game of life took most of my day so I wasn't able to make a good recap of the last month, I'll do it after I finish the game of life project.

Happy hackin'!
