Day 15

I have done a lot in the last 2 weeks, I've learned git/github, HTML semantic elements, CSS, SASS even took a glance and gulp. I've done some solo projects and also some write alongs.

I think I've grown, I can almost without second thought use CSS and I imagine with a few more days of practice SASS aswell and I can also put a solid HTML together with the semantic elements.

This is why I started (finally) with JavaScript, I think it's the obvious way to go from here and I'm excited to finally start doing it.

I have some basic understanding of it but I only used it once in a real project and it was mostly copy/paste code from a library. 

It shoudl be fun.

Happy coding
