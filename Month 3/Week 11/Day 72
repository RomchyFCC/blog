Day 72

Finally, a very good day, I am back.

I was working ona  new project the entire day, learning by doing in React.
Many dependencies in action like browser history, router, route, switch and so on.

I am learning a lot and am absolutely disapointed by the fact that the "app" I am making would be so much better with backend support.
Not enough knowledge for that yet, I could force it, but I refuse to fall into a pit of never ending studying and by that I mean, the cycle of finding a component that works,
ask myself how it works, find a tutorial, learn about the component, update the app and repeat. That takes ages and would prevent me from actually doing something.

I have been studying for the last week and a half, now I will use the knowledge to make some app, then go back to learning again.

The planned projects are: finish the recipe app, create a town of salem app that identifies posibilites for the game and outputs them given on the input and information provided,
do all 4 apps in the FCC map.

It will be a busy week and hopes to finish by the end of next thursday have diminished.

I will still try my best.

As a reminder, the plan for tomorrow is to finish the recipe book(add comment interactivity and styles) and start with the town of salem app.

Happy codin'!
