Day 78

Very exciting day, I had the pleasure to interview with a company I'm very interested in working with.

I got a coding challenge, so they get a better look into my work process.

It's an interesting little challenge which I'm very motivated to complete asap. I managed to complete the basic layout, tomorrow is a css day.

I will upload this challenge to codepen most likely as it's easiest to share and won't put it on github just yet although it seems reasonable to do so.

More coding tomorrow!

Happy hackin'
