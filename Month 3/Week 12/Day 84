Day 84

Been working on the recipe box app from FCC data visualization, completing most of the logic in the app but I have a problem with identical items, which I plan to fix tomorrow and add
some styles and local storage.

Shouldn't be too hard, but I've been distracted lately, I hope I can finish this project and make the game of life at least half way through.

G' night!
