Day 83

Work has been slow this last couple of days, the nerves are kinda getting to me argghhh.
Took some time off and worked on quick projects like the camper leaderboard and markdown previewer. Wasn't too much work but great react experiences anyway.

I really got my spirits up and I'm ready for new challenges, new knowledge but most of all new experiences.

Night!
