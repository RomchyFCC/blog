Day 61

Wow, this went on way longer that I originally expected, but it's finally done.
Fully responsive with the possibility to add content to my webpage with zero effort! My portfolio page is done!
Tomorrow I finish my wordpress template and I move on from there, diving into the hosting and backend of things was a fun detour but after this straight back to react projects.

I will also set aside some time daily for my personal projects because I feel confident I can finish them. I'm feeling around 4hrs for study, 4hrs for fcc projects and 4hrs for personal projects.
That seems fair and it might get me where I want to go.

Other than that, I also learned about mailchimp and active campaing today. Learning a lot about the CRM applications. I realised I love how comprehensive Net-Results is,
and how simple active campaign is. 

Happy coding!
