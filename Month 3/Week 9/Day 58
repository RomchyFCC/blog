Day 58

Dreadful, I wasted most of my day, I tried to implement a backend for my site but all the tools I tried did not work, so I am waiting on hostgator to propogate my site.
Hopefully everything works and is ok, so I can start developing a real project, minify it, uglify it all that stuff.

I hope this will be done tomorrow, I really do, I have other projects to attend to :/
