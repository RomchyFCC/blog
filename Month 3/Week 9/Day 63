Day 63

Was more of an administrative day, I had some errands to take care of.

I have done some more wordpress work, but not a lot since there wasn't a lot of time and I added some finesse code into my personal portfolio site.

I can't wait to add my blog extension to it, I think it's gonna be awesome.

Bigger update probably tomorrow when I'm closer to that goal.

Happy codin'!
