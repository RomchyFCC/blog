Day 128

What an awesome day, I created 3 and a half applications, 2 of which were back end and one was mostly javascript based.

Great day and tomorrow only gets more exciting. I/ll finish my fourth application and complete 3 courses planned for this weekend so I can finally move on.

I hope I get time to start with my wordpress project, so much to do so little time :/

Happy coding!
