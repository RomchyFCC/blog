Day 6

I almost forgot to do today's blog, I was already in bed when I realized I completely forgot.

Today was another good day, I started on a completely solo project, a site using only CSS and HTML. It's a project to really sink in the knowledge I already obtained. I also dabbled with a bit of flex and some more on responsive design. I am excited for tomorrow because I will do the Google's Responsive Web Design course on Udacity.

I hope I learn a lot from the experts. 

As I go through the course, I will also try to complete my solo project, but the course is supposed to be 14 hours long so I don't really see that happening but will do my best.

So that's it for today, happy coding.
