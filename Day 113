Day 113

I've done some prep work for tomorrow, today was very eciting but I was to tired to make anything of value. Now that I started the job, I need to alter my learning path as
 it seems I'll be diving more into php. So I will focus on that for now and spend some time learning the ins and outs of that.

 I'll try to come back to my project but it seems highly unlikely at this time.

 More news tomorrow :)
