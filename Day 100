Day 100

DING DING DING! 
We crossed the first goal line, well several more were crossed during this period but this is a "bigger" one.

I am working on my wordpress blog so there isn't a lot to post to github but the project is coming along swell xD who uses that word lol anyway
I wanna put this behind me create a platform and do the whole "set it, forget it" thing to it.

Once that is done I am focusing on React/Redux probably GraphQL as well. Last stop before I fully move onto the back end.
Can't wait.

Happy hackin'!
