Day 47

Wow, I am at a loss for words,

today everything I stand for, everything I know, even the smallest possible things got a huge dump of crap on them.

I managed to get 2 courses down, both quite good to be honest, good refreshers, but I am physically and emotionally exausted.

Can't do anything anymore today, early bed for me.
