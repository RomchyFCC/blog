A lot more progress since yesterday,
was disapointed to see that hackerRank wasn't working.

I found a new home in coding challenges, it was really fun today, when I did a couple of them.

I also went through an entire algorith section on FCC and had done the random quote generator project and started the weather one.

I am guessing that by tomorrow's end I will do the weather one and the wiki viewer aswell.

At least I hope so, I don't think they will be great pieces of art, but just enough for me to feel good about the project and for it to pass on FCC "requirements".

Looking forward to tomorrow :)

Beware of the coder :o
