Day 74


YESSSSSS, I finally created the core functionality of my app. It took ages to figure out all the forks in the road and I'm still wondering if there is a better way to solve it/make it,
whatever, I think of my apps as puzzle pieces being put together, sue me :D

Even though the core functionalitywas only implemented in classic mode, it will be well suited in ranked aswell so I'm excited to try it tomorrow.

I might give styling a shot tomorrow, because I want a better look for the app, looking at black and white screen all day is very tiresome for my eyes.

More news tomorrow, arrivederci!
