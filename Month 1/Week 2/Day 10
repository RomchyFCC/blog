Day 10

WooOOOOooooOO, absolutely awesome day.
I had slept very well and was very productive through the entire day.

I finished with flexbox zombies, took quite a long time to complete but i think I learned quite a fair bit and also hardened the foundation that have been building for a few days now.

I also finished with Net Ninja's CSS Grid tutorial after which I built a fun little project to express my feelings to my significant other, fully responsive too :)

Link for the course in the readme.

I'm excited for tomorrow, gonna do Wes Bos Courses, should be fun.

Happy coding
