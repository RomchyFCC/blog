Day 13

So, today was very productive, I tried to do 2 days of work in one because tomorrow is my day off(sort of :D). I'll try to get in a few lines of code, and maybe get through a book.

I went through bootstrap tutorials, CSS animation plus tips and trick. So I think it really helped with the enlargment of my toolkit. I feel a lot more comfortable with css keyframes and creating things in css where we would normally need javascript.

Bootstrap felt super easy this second time around, I think the good foundation of css helped a lot on that part, when i was first reading about bootstrap 3, I had zero idea what's going on, now it's super easy.
I'm excited to work with it more.

And lastly, I also started working in SASS and am doing exercises for it. Quite interesting. So that's also what I'll try to do tomorrow if I get any spare time.

Happy coding
