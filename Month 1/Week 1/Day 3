Day 3

A much more productive day then usual, i like it.

I went through the rest of HTML and CSS course on learn.shayhowe.com i think it is.
And i even finished the advanced portion, though it was very compact so it's more of a refference log then a course.

For tomorrow I'll use everything i learned in the last 2 days and see how far I get on the codecademy tutorials, which will also be my segway into javascript.

I also finished the Revival project on my github, it's a mess for sure but it's just everything i learned thrown in there, wasn't really paying attention on how i put it as long as it works.

I might update it as time goes on but for now I'll leave it like that and focus on other project, one of them also being responsive design, which i think i'll get into either tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

That't that, happy coding!
