Day 24

Well well well, first React-ive day, getting used to JSX. I've grown quite fond of react, I played with an app made with react and did some test runs with mohca, chai and enzyme.

I'm in the CLI a lot more since today, it's wierd but i'm getting used to it.

I'm going through the course really slowly, it's kinda hard, a lot of new stuff and I feel a bit disconnected from it, don't have that drive, because it just keeps piling on.
So, today I worked mostly on familiarity, I did homework 4 which is ok, but it was a short homework so I should ahve done more, but i didn't :/

I will do the rest of the course hopefully tomorrow, so I can then transition back to basics, to renew everything I learned in the past 23 days and then start with databases.
Obviously I'm excited about the projects because I have a lot of ideas that I want to put out there.

So yea, I will try to speed this up a bit. Go back to familiar things to get the drive back and then sometimes that is outside my comfort zone.
Till tomorrow duhh. happy hacking! :)
