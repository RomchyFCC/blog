Day 28

I have been working on and off for about 11 hours now, I'm quite exausted so I'll call it for today.

It's been a month, time went by so fast, especially when I started falling behind in what I wanted to accomplish in 1 month.

For the tidiness of the repo I will keep 4 weeks per month and ignore the left over days.

So yea, It's a good feeling, I think I came quite far, I have a much better understanding of all technologies I'm faced with since the last time I tried programming.

Everything seems so much easier now.

I'm excited to build my next projects, meet some more new technologies like a SQL db or REST API.

There is no going back now and I'm looking forward to my next challenge.
