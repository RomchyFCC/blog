Day 21

Wow, I can't believe I've been coding for 21 days straight now. It was moving so slo at first but now days are just passing by.

I can't even begin to explain how awesome this is.

Today I went through half of an edx course and I expect I'll be done with it tomorrow.

Just some logical if puzzles that need solving.

Can't wait to see what tomorrow's projects will be.

Also, darren advertised the s*** out of our little github project, I really hope it gets some traction, should be good for us and especially the community.

Just trying to give something back you know....

Happy coding!
