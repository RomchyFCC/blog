Day 67

I finished the wordpress blog. I'm not that excited about it. 
Took a lot of corners on it and I haven't made a burger navigation.

I have to test it in a real environment now.
I'm gonna do that tomorrow, I'm very tired today.

So that's it for today, I'll be going to sleep early today, need to reset my bio-rythm.

Happy codin'
