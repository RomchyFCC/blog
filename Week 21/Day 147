Day 147

I got some styles up and running today, CSS is starting to feel very natural to me.
The whole process of getting a website up to production level is almost mastered to be honest.
I am also practicing wordpress a lot and learning the X theme and the newspaper theme along the way.
A lot of learning and stuff, just not a lot of time for my pet projects and things I want to work on, like my github OSS community.

It's getting better though so I'm happy for now :D
