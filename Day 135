Day 135

Quite an exausting day, refactored some of my code from previous days since I found bugs that I haven't fixed.
I felt cringy not delivering my best product, it was good, but it could have been great given a bit more time to work with.

I'm learning a lot about time management and time/quality ratio which seems more important in the working world.

That's it for today.

Happy coding!
