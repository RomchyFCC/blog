So today is a very important day, for me of course.

I finally quit my job which means I finally have more time to pursue this career.

Everyone is being supportive of the decision i have made and I am really trying my best not to let them down or me for that matter.

I think i mostly decided on the whole blog thing to keep track of my progress and see where I end up reletive to myself in 3, 6 months.

My plan when I got back was also to go through the YDJKS and CS50 but since I already done those I just skimmed through quickly and that's why I am already ahead of schedule.

Ahead of schedule??? As an aspiring developer???
Well yes, I wanted to start this in a week (when I am officially jobless) but I pushed my learning into a higher gear and am working my ass off. 

So right now, I already re-learned git and the usage of repositories and getting into branch managment with a party, already re-watched all cs50 lectures and have started ShayHowe's CSS course.

I'm planning on finishing that by the end of the week since as of tomorrow, I get all the hours of the day for myself.

Should be exciting
