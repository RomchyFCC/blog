Day 70

I've done some more react and redux learning, but for complexity's sake. I am for now done with redux.

I am going to do an indepth learning session for react tomorrow, I expect it to last about a day, then I am going to do 8 consecutive projects 4-5 of which are FCC related.

So many I's so little time :)

I'm done for today and also I hope I'm done with my "phase" of unproductivity.

Happy codin'!
