Day 64

I finally completed all of my hosting/domain stuff. My portfolio is polished and done.

I also developed on my wordpress theme a bit, but the hosting took most of my day.
I sketched out a design for the blog, but will most likely change it through time till it perfectly fits my portfolio.

I will also do my best to make the theme as widely applicable as possible so others can have something out of this.

All my sentences start with I, that should be fixed somehow. It's a journal but still not every damn sentence should start with an I :s
Other than that, React course I found seems pretty good, gonna do it tomorrow(rewatch and code along to it).

That's it,
Happy codin'
