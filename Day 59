Day 59

Was working around in wordpress/php, fun stuff. Made a small ugly template which i intend to finish tomorrow along with my resume.
I hope by then my website will be up so I can upload and test my backend in real world application, I want to minify and prefix my site, but dunno if it's finished yet.

Anyhow, tomorrow will be exciting.

Happy codin'
