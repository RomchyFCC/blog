Day 106

Finished the React course today, gonna start with GD50 tomorrow I think and I will try to devide time between wordpress blog and that for the next week or 2.
I wanna learn redux but I might not have enough time anymore. We will see. I also started teaching my older brother programming and it's exciting to go over the basics again.
It's good to see some core concepts really stuck with me and how that helped me learn faster and become a better dev.

More tomorrow I guess, GN!
