Day 161

I've done some heavy wordpress programming today and some SOAP service calls, I have no idea if my code is bad or if the SOAP service is not properly implemented.

I'll get to the bottom of it soon perhaps.

I've also made some backend scripts, one of which ran for ~21hrs. I'm sort of proud of that :D

Much better day than yesterday thats for sure.

Happy coding!
