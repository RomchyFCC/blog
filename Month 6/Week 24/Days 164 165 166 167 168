WOAH!

Right???

Yea new system. Daily updates are more like quantity instead of quality, they also clutter my github profile and make it look like I don't develop rather than the other way around.
I decided on weekly updates rather than daily. The focus point should be "I am developing/growing/learning" not "yea, taking a break/the job is taking most of my time".

I do develop but on most days I use up all my hours developing and don't have time to run everything through github because I mostly work with live servers now and the code is stored there.

I will have projects that are my own soon enough and I will also update my OSS project, but the job is more important. I reckon I'll have some free time in the upcoming month.

BY THE WAY, HUGE NEWS: 6 months of development
Yup, will update my blog titles and stuff.

See, it's already showing, quality over quantity is the way!

Happy coding!
