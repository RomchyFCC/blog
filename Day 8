Day 8

Today I learned a bit more about FLEX in CSS, I didn't really put it to good use, i just fiddled around with my project a bit, to try and make it a bit more responsive.

I did help my former co-worker with something related to programing and was succesful there which I am feeling quite good about. I worked in excel visual basic to achieve, copying a table of 700+ items and put it in alphabetical order so it's easier to find those items.

I was lazy after that and wasted the entirety of my day for absolutely nothing. I had fun but looking back now, it wasn't really worth it, it almost never is. Maybe i needed a break, I've been going full speed on this for 10 days +. 

Tomorrow though is back to buisness as usual, gotta get that excitement back!

Happy coding!
