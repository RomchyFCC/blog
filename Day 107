Day 107

Today was one of those more productive days, even though, I was tired for most of it. I think I managed to do more today because I feel much better than the last few days.
I decided on learning redux for the next 2 days, so I can focus on and complete all the projects I have set before starting my first day in a new company.

It's probably an impossible task but I have to try.
Courses to do: 
  3 redux courses
  2 youtube video code alongs

Projects to do: 
  full stack chess elo leaderboard
  trivia game in redux
  wordpress blog new look + first post

Yup, pretty much impossible to do in less than a week, I will give it my best though.

Good night!
