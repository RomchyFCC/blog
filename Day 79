Day 79

Exciting day, I completed the coding challenge/test that was sent to me by the company I would love to work with.
I completed the whole project without frameworks or libraries. Would using a library like jquery save me time and code on the project? Yes, most likely it would,
but I decided against it so that I test myself if I'm capable of writing good clean code.

I mostly used ES6 syntax which at this point should already be the norm annyway, but still worth noting I guess.

I'm excited to hear back from them to see how I did.

Happy codin'!
