Day 25

Uff, getting close to a month now.

Today I completed another assignment in the EdX course, it was quite difficult, because you get a bunch of files that you first need to read through and with bad understanding it's hard to see what's actually going on, but I eventually got it and I aced the task :).

React has a wierd way of passing around data, but hey, it gets the job done.

I'm excited for tomorrow(it's also the reason I'm finishing very early today), I'll be doing Node.js and mongoDB exercises.
It's been a while since I've done those but I like node and mongoDB and I really just can't wait. 
I would do it today but there is no way I'll be done in 1 hour so I'll use this time to chill, maybe read some docs.

Happy hackin'!
