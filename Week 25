Week 25

Just what I needed! A huge vacation, I've been out partying, relaxing, climbing everything that came to my mind, I did it in the last 2 weeks. I feel rejuvinated and I'm ready to take on the next challenge.
Don't get me wrong I have been coding most of the week days but have not found time nor the will to write these short blogs. I'm coming back but since I'm developing at work I decided to try and grow in my personal area to so 
I'm focusing on myself and learning things that are not related to development.

Anyway, I have been doing just soo much PHP development, it's just so awesome, I'm running scripts even up to a day, they are fairly optimized but the API calls take it's toll on them.
Most of my work is in wordpress and I've learned so much working in it.

I feel accomplished, more news soon, hopefully it will be about my personal projects coming up in a short while.
As a reminder for myself I need to update my OSS project!

Have a great week!
