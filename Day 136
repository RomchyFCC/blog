Day 136

Days flying by so fast and I still can/t get a grip on everything, tomorrow might be a change of pace and maybe actually coming ahead of work.

Hoping to succeed and to finally start up my own projects. Wierdly enough, I am well taken care of for my interests at my job. Everything that ever 
interested me is popping up as a "passion" way of growing at the work place. I just might let go and throw myself in fully :)

I also quite happy because I am helping my older brother grow as a person and a developer. We finally found a common interest and we are spending quite a lot of time together.
It's wierd and cool at the same time, I never thought we'd grow up like this, truly makes me happy.

GN!
