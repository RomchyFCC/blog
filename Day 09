Day 9

Ugh, speechless.

Wasn't as productive as I wanted to be. The lack of sleep might be the cause for my uncontrolable laziness.

I did manage to start and half-ass my 2nd solo project to the finish line. It look "okay" but i know I could do more to improve it and clean up the code. 

Not enough though, I'll take an early night tonight and see if I can get enough sleep to get back into normal rythem tomorrow.

Happy coding :)
