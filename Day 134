Day 134

I was working on front end for internet explorer. Who knew internet explorer is so hard to please.
Learned a lot in the last 2 days, I think this knowledge will make me a better developer all in all.

I was mostly annoyed but now that the project is done I feel great, learning so much new stuff related to internet explorer.

I will also take the time to segment the code I am building to speed up my workflow.

It/s gonna be great!
