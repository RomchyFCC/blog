Day 41

Coming close to an end of week 6 and also close to FCC front end certificate, I hope.

I say I hope because I really didn't soend a lot of time on my FCC projects, they are very minimalistic and quite possibly ugly.

I did the tic tac toe game today, yeeey, it's not much but it should pass the inspection.

Now for the last one in front end, simons game, seems tough but i might have an idea how to make it really simple with an array.

Feeling better than the last 2 days, but i'll feel even better if i'm done with this by tomorrow :)

Cya soon
