Day 132

Today I wrote some front end stuff and did CRM related learning. I am also currently doin an inbound marketing course, so I can get back to my personal projects.

It's actually a lot harder to focus on other stuff at the moment given how destroyed my bio rythm became. It's actually been a while since I woke up and went straight to the computer to program.

I will try to make that habbit again, I've just felt so exausted for the last month. Need some physical activity to get back that mental energy I am currently lacking.

Happy hackin!
